      <h3>TECHNICAL ARCHITECT II</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Taha Elsayed, and I am a Technical Architect with 20+ years of experience in software development and architecture, specializing in public cloud, .NET, and REST technologies. I have designed and implemented complex and innovative solutions for clients in various industries, such as telecom, healthcare, property taxes, and biotech, using Azure and AWS cloud platforms.

      <p>
        In my most recent role at Integrant, Inc., I advised on the technologies, architecture, and best practices for digital transformation projects. I led and supported multiple teams to ensure high performance, quality, and alignment with business goals. I have a PMP diploma, an MCAD certification, and a pre-master degree in computer software engineering. I am currently pursuing a master's degree in computer science at Maharishi International University.
      </p>
      <p>
        I aim to leverage my expertise and passion for software architecture and innovation to create value and impact for businesses and users. I am always eager to learn new technologies and domains and to collaborate with diverse and talented teams. I am available for full-time W-2 employment and willing to relocate.
