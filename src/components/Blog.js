        <p>
          Here’s a detailed example of how you can use DAPR to integrate with Azure KeyVault to securely manage secrets in your application.
        </p>
        <h5>Step 1: Install DAPR CLI and Initialize DAPR</h5>
        <pre>
          <code>
{`# Install DAPR CLI
$ wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dapr/cli/master/install/install.sh -O - | /bin/bash

# Initialize DAPR
$ dapr init
`}
          </code>
        </pre>
        <h5>Step 2: Set Up Your Azure KeyVault and Create a Secret</h5>
        <p>
          First, create a KeyVault in Azure and add a secret to it. For this example, we'll create a secret named "my-secret" with the value "super-secret-value".
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
{`# Create an Azure KeyVault
$ az keyvault create --name myKeyVault --resource-group myResourceGroup --location eastus

# Add a secret to the KeyVault
$ az keyvault secret set --vault-name myKeyVault --name my-secret --value super-secret-value
`}
          </code>
        </pre>
        <h5>Step 3: Configure DAPR to Use Azure KeyVault</h5>
        <p>
          Next, create a component file named "keyvault.yaml" with the following content to configure DAPR to use Azure KeyVault:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
{`apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: mykeyvault
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: secretstores.azure.keyvault
  version: v1
  metadata:
  - name: vaultName
    value: myKeyVault
  - name: spnClientId
    value: <YOUR_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_CLIENT_ID>
  - name: spnClientSecret
    value: <YOUR_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_CLIENT_SECRET>
  - name: spnTenantId
    value: <YOUR_AZURE_TENANT_ID>
`}
          </code>
        </pre>
        <h5>Step 4: Use DAPR in Your Application to Retrieve the Secret</h5>
        <p>
          In your application code, use the DAPR HTTP API to retrieve the secret from KeyVault:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
{`import fetch from 'node-fetch';

const secretName = 'my-secret';
const daprPort = process.env.DAPR_HTTP_PORT || 3500;

async function getSecret() {
  const response = await fetch(\`http://localhost:\${daprPort}/v1.0/secrets/mykeyvault/\${secretName}\`);
  const secret = await response.json();
  console.log('Retrieved secret:', secret);
}

getSecret();
`}
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          By following these steps, you can securely manage your secrets using Azure KeyVault and DAPR, allowing your application to access secrets in a secure and controlled manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Azure Container Apps, KEDA, and DAPR together provide a powerful and flexible platform for building, deploying, and managing modern cloud-native applications. Leveraging these tools can significantly enhance your development workflow and ensure your applications are scalable, resilient, and secure.
